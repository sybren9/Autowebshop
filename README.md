# Autowebshop


This is a carshop made in JSP, done for a school project.

The idea behind the project is as following;

We create an arraylist of cars (autolijst.java) and we create a method to filter results (autolijst getFilter).
Also checks if correct values were entered (so we don't result in a crash error)


If installed right it should look like this:
